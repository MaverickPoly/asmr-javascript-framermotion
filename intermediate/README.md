## List of Projects and Programs

### **UI & Component-Based Animations**

1. **Advanced Modal with Staggered Animations** – Create a modal that appears with staggered animations for different elements like text, buttons, and background overlays.
2. **3D Card Flip Animation** – Use `useTransform` and `animatePresence` to create interactive flipping cards.
3. **Expandable Sidebar Navigation** – Design a smooth expanding/collapsing sidebar with staggered menu items.
4. **Drag & Drop List with Motion Effects** – Implement a draggable list where items animate smoothly into place when rearranged.

### **Page & Layout Transitions**

6. **Multi-Step Form with Animated Transitions** – Create a multi-step form where each step has a smooth transition (slide, fade, scale effects).
7. **Custom Cursor with Interactive Effects** – Build a custom cursor that scales and morphs depending on elements it hovers over.
8. **Glassmorphism Component** – Implement a simple component with _glassmorphism_ design.
9. **Portfolio Page with Scroll-Based Animations** – Use `useScroll` to animate sections as they come into view.
